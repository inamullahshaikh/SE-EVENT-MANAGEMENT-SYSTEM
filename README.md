## **TIMELINE**

### 1. **Use Cases Implemented**

#### **Event Organizer Use Cases**
- As an Event Organizer, I want to create an event so that I can manage attendee registrations.
- As an Event Organizer, I want to register attendees so that they can participate in the event.
- As an Event Organizer, I want to manage events so that I can ensure smooth execution and attendee engagement.
- As an Event Organizer, I want to manage attendees so that I can track registrations and ensure event capacity is not exceeded.
- As an Event Organizer, I want to generate event analysis so that I can evaluate event success and plan future improvements.
- As an Event Organizer, I need to customize event details to enhance attendee experience.

#### **Attendee Use Cases**
- As an Attendee, I want to register for an event so that I can participate.
- As an Attendee, I want to receive a payment confirmation so that I can be assured my registration was successful.
- As an Attendee, I want to provide feedback so that I can share my experience and help improve future events.
- As a Frequent Attendee, I want to earn loyalty points so that I can redeem them for discounts or rewards.

#### **System Administrator Use Cases**
- As a System Administrator, I want to add or remove Event Organizers so that only authorized and active organizers can manage events effectively.
- As a System Administrator, I want to view and respond to user queries so that I can assist users and resolve their issues.
- As a System Administrator, I want to generate event analysis reports so that I can monitor overall platform performance and improve event management.

#### **General User Use Cases**
- As a User, I need to login and register to access my account.
- As a User, I want to receive email updates about events so that I stay informed about important changes.
- As a User, I want to submit queries to the admin so that I can get help with my issues or concerns.

### 2. **Architecture Selection**
We will use the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack** for this project because:

- **MongoDB** â€“ NoSQL database for flexible event and user data storage.
- **Express.js** â€“ Backend framework to handle API requests.
- **React.js** â€“ Frontend framework for a dynamic and responsive UI.
- **Node.js** â€“ Handles backend logic and API endpoints efficiently.

#### **Other Tools & Libraries**
- **Redux** â€“ State management in React.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** â€“ Authentication.
- **Stripe/PayPal API** â€“ Payment processing.
- **Nodemailer** â€“ Email notifications.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging** â€“ Push notifications.
- **Socket.io** â€“ Real-time updates (e.g., attendee count).

## **ðŸ“‚ Project Structure**
Since your project follows a microservices approach, here's how it is structured:

```
ðŸ“‚ event-management-system/
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ attendee-service/            # Handles attendee registration and participation
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ booking-service/             # Manages event bookings and reservations
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ event-organizer-service/     # Handles event creation and management by organizers
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ event-service/               # Core service for handling event-related data
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ frontend/                    # React.js frontend application
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ notification-service/        # Sends email and push notifications
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ payment-service/             # Integrates with Stripe/PayPal for ticket payments
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ queries-service/             # Handles user queries and FAQs
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ user-service/                # Manages authentication and user profiles
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ package.json                 # Project dependencies and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ README.md                    # Project documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ run.bat                      # Batch script to start services
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ node_modules/                # Installed Node.js dependencies

- **Docker** (for containerization, if used)
- **RabbitMQ** (for async communication, if used)

### **Run the Project**
#### **Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/event-management-system.git
cd event-management-system
```

#### **Run the Project using the Batch File**
```sh
run.bat
