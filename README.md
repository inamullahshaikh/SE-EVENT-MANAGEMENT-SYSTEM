As an Event Organizer, I need to customize event details to enhance attendee experience.

Attendee Use Cases
As an Attendee, I want to register for an event so that I can participate.

As an Attendee, I want to receive a payment confirmation so that I can be assured my registration was successful.

As an Attendee, I want to provide feedback so that I can share my experience and help improve future events.

As a Frequent Attendee, I want to earn loyalty points so that I can redeem them for discounts or rewards.

System Administrator Use Cases

As a System Administrator, I want to generate event analysis reports so that I can monitor overall platform performance and improve event management.

General User Use Cases
As a User, I need to login and register to access my account.

As a User, I want to receive email updates about events so that I stay informed about important changes.

As a User, I want to submit queries to the admin so that I can get help with my issues or concerns.

2. Architecture Selection
We will use the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack for this project because:

MongoDB: NoSQL database for flexible event and user data storage.

Express.js: Backend framework to handle API requests.

React.js: Frontend framework for a dynamic and responsive UI.

Node.js: Handles backend logic and API endpoints efficiently.

Other Tools & Libraries
Redux for state management in React.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

Stripe/PayPal API for payments.

Nodemailer for email notifications.

Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications.

Socket.io for real-time updates (e.g., attendee count).

## **Updated README Sections:**

### **📂 Project Structure**
Your directory structure (based on the image) follows a microservices approach. Here's how you can document it:
