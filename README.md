### _Event Management System Web Application - Detailed Breakdown & Timeline_

#### _1. Architecture Selection_

We will use the _MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)_ stack for this project because:

- _MongoDB_: NoSQL database for flexible event and user data storage.
- _Express.js_: Backend framework to handle API requests.
- _React.js_: Frontend framework for a dynamic and responsive UI.
- _Node.js_: Handles backend logic and API endpoints efficiently.

_Other Tools & Libraries:_

- _Redux_ for state management in React.
- _JWT (JSON Web Tokens)_ for authentication.
- _Stripe/PayPal API_ for payments.
- _Nodemailer_ for email notifications.
- _Firebase Cloud Messaging_ for push notifications.
- _Socket.io_ for real-time updates (e.g., attendee count).
